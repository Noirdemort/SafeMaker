# SafeMaker

A GUI for [VaultMaker](https://github.com/Noirdemort/VaultMaker.git).

Basically, This app uses 
  - A master password (keep it secret)
  - The sitename
  - Date of Birth (Or basically any date that you can remember)
 
THIS APP PRODUCES REPRODUCIBLE PASSWORDS, So as long as you remember everything you entered you can regenerate those passwords.



# TODO

1. Improve GUI
2. Add support for biometric


# NOTE: Before using the app, please set a new master password.

# FAQ

**Q1.** The app seems to run slow?  
**Ans.** Yes, it is by design. If app is generating passwords too fast... contact the author. The author will provide you with your system optimized iteration.
The average time for generating one should be anywhere between 5 to 20 seconds.  

**Q2.** This app is cool but I cant find its counterpart on App Store?  
**Ans.** You wont until you pay me to buy a developer account and maintain it.  

> 2560 to 3072 number of iterations are good enough.

**Q3.** Why this UI sucks?  
**Ans.** I dont give a fuck.  

**Q4.** How can I sync it across my multiple devices or when I change my device?  
**Ans.** You cant. Passwords are discardable entities. Dont be lazy... change them when you change your device. Also you can get the same ones if you use the same data again.  


**Q5.** Why is there no security option like TouchID or some other fuckery?  
**Ans.** I will integrate if number of users grow considerably or if you really need it.
